# Minesweeper-Replica
Project for ECE150.

This application, which I've named geesespotter, is a clone of the beloved game Minesweeper. 
To create and manipulate the board, I used dynamically allocated arrays with chars, representing the open spaces/mines. 
Since each element in the array is a char containing 8 bits, I used bitwise operations to either mark or reveal the space on the board.
